when migrating to a different machine, remember to:

CONFIGURE APACHE
1. install mod_wsgi:
apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3 python-dev

2. edit the configuration for the enabled site:

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName steadfast
        DocumentRoot /var/www/html/
        ...
        # NEW
        # Give an alias to to start your website url with
        WSGIScriptAlias /alias /home/pi/code/Steadfast/website/website.wsgi
        <Directory /home/pi/code/Steadfast/website/>
            # set permissions as per apache2.conf file
            Options FollowSymLinks
            AllowOverride None
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
        # END OF NEW

        ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
        ...
</VirtualHost>

NOTE: the .wsgi file and the .py file MUST have the same name. The do not have to be in the same folder.

3. edit the site.wsgi file to update the proper location of where it is contained
NOTE: the location in the .wsgi file reflects the location of the .py file
